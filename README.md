# textrecognizer

This is an Android app that utilizes MLKit to scan an image for text then allow the user to easily copy the text for usage elsewhere.

This is most useful when you have a physical document that you want only a small section of text from, so that you can quickly send it to your friend or colleague.

## Purpose
I built this app because I experienced many occasions where I saw a physical document that I wanted to be able to copy the text of. I would only be able to snap a picture, but would have to manually enter the text if I were to want to save it. As a result, I decided to build this so that I could quickly grab the text and do whatever I needed to do with it.

## Features
- Capture image
- Load image from gallery
- Convert the image and scan image for text
- Box to copy the gathered text
